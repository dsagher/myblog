# On Distraction & Discomfort

I’m often lured towards things that don’t just cost attention, but consume it. Gawking at chaos on X in the morning.  Career comparisons on LinkedIn during the day. Sleep optimization YouTube videos before bed. 

Each has their own internal logic. To feel a part of society, I try to stay informed. To succeed professionally, I check in on my network. To feel better, I attempt to self-improve.

However, this reasoning is not the reason, but the post-hoc explanation. In times of deliberate self-reflection (such as now), I can reason about why. But most of the time, no conscious thought leads me to engage with distracting technology.

While my after-the-fact reasons for engaging with distracting technology are not necessarily bad–they are reasons, at least–I’ve come to find that most of my interactions with modern technology are not about acquiring or producing information. They are about seeking relief from unexamined discomfort.

## Examining Discomfort

In 6th grade, I struggled with intense social anxiety. I benefitted a lot from therapy–“naming it and reframing it”. In high school, I stopped therapy and drifted into delinquency. In college, talking to a therapist helped me put my life back together.

Structured talk therapy taught me how to poke holes in unconscious thought patterns. It made clear who in my life was only causing me pain, and who I was taking for granted. Therapy repeatedly brought me to the edge of my ability to put thoughts to words.

But as I matured into my mid-twenties, I increasingly found myself at a loss for words. It was not because my English vocabulary had not advanced at pace with my capacity for self-insight. Rather, I’d reached the point in my journey where words failed–my wheels spun, but didn’t move me forward. Sessions started to leave me exhausted and agitated. I began assigning meaning to situations in life that would otherwise be benign. I was trying to name something that could not be named. 

## What Cannot Be Named

Like clockwork, the weight of the discomfort that cannot be named began to hit me at 27. I had stopped therapy and started journaling. I would write a page every morning, analyzing the day before and declaring how I will treat the day ahead differently. I enjoyed starting my day with a cup of coffee and a pen. 

But after a few Moleskines, I realized I was falling into the same habits as before. I was still white-knuckling life, ruminating on things that did not deserve a second thought.

One morning, when staring over a notebook, tired of recounting, repenting, and resetting, I tried nothing. It wasn’t long before I began shifting in my chair, looking around, reaching for my pen, coffee, phone–anything. I was so uncomfortable that I went back to writing.

> *I’m so uncomfortable that I don’t know what else to do other than write. La la la I’m just writing to occupy the space.*
> 

A page of nothing, to avoid being.

## Distraction

My relationship with technology is complicated. I’m fortunate to be writing this on beautiful free software, with the expectation that someone I’ve never met is going to read it. Though, I still romanticize scenes in early period pieces where a character looks longingly out of a window, unburdened by the option to look away at their phone.

I’ve come to see attention less as something to deploy well, and more as something to practice remaining with. When I lose it, my life quickly narrows and numbs; when I stay with it long enough, the discomfort diminishes to reveal calmness and clarity. For now, it means practicing small pockets of nothing, and noticing what remains when I don’t immediately reach for relief.
